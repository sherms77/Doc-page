        <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
        <p>It is used for:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>web development (server-side),</li>
            <li>software development,</li>
            <li>mathematics,</li>
            <li>system scripting.</li>

            <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
            <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
            <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>

        <ul> 
            <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
            <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
            <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
            <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Python is often considered a good language for beginners because of its simple syntax.</p>

            The most recent major version of Python is Python 3. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security         updates, is still quite popular.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are               particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also write Python in text editors such as: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad ++ and Atom.

        </header>
        <p>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</p>
        <p>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</p>
        <p>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming     languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>

        <p>This is a print statement:</p>
        <code>print('Hello World!')</code>
        <p>This is how you assign a value to a variable:</p>
        <code>variable = 'spam'</code>
        <p>This is how you convert a string data type to an integer (int):</p>
        <code>int('1')</code>
        <p>This is how you convert an integer data type to a string (str):</p>
        <code>str(5)</code>
        <p>This is how you ask the user for input with an input statement:</p>
        <code>input('Enter your name:')</code>
